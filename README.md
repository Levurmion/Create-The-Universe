# Create The Universe

This repository is my deep dive into programming without the conveniences of garbage-collected languages. With the aim to understand how data structures and algorithms perform close to the hardware, I will be attempting to recreate implementations of high-level objects in `C++`. With unfettered access to the memory of our compute space, I could come out the other side a programming wizard or missing a leg - remains to be seen.

Following the `C/C++` philosophy:

> *To bake a cake, you need to first **Create The Universe**!*

I will be building everything I need from scratch. This is not a project of efficiency. It is a deliberate journey taking the scenic route to teach myself everything a CS degree could without the blowing my bank account.
